# Synthetic LiDAR Scanning in Unity

This Unity project simulates a synthetic LiDAR scanning process, with a customizable sensor and path. The simulation generates point cloud data from 3D models as the LiDAR sensor moves along a predefined path. This project is ideal for testing LiDAR-based algorithms and generating synthetic datasets.

## **Features**
1. **LiDAR Sensor Simulation**  
   A configurable LiDAR sensor capable of scanning 3D models and simulating realistic noise effects.

2. **Model Loader**  
   Automatically loads OBJ models from a specified directory for scanning. Models are defined in a `.lst` file.

3. **Customizable Sensor Path**  
   The sensor follows a circular path, with options for scaling, rotation, and multiple rescans.

4. **Output Data**  
   Generates and saves point clouds for scanned frames in the specified output directory.

## **Project Components**

### **1. LiDAR Sensor**
- Simulates a LiDAR sensor with configurable field of view, resolution, and noise characteristics.
- Generates point cloud data for each scan frame.

### **2. Model Loader**
- Reads the `.lst` file specified in `in_path` to load 3D models in OBJ format for scanning.
- Supports multiple models for batch processing.

### **3. Sensor Path**
- Follows a circular path by default, with options for scaling, rotation, and randomization.
- Configurable rescanning behavior for capturing multiple scans with variations.

## **Usage Instructions**

### **1. Set Up the Project**
- Open the project in Unity.
- Ensure the `StreamingAssets` folder contains the required models and a valid `.lst` file to test the project inside the Unity editor

### **2. Configure Parameters**
- Use the command-line arguments listed above to configure the sensor and scanning behavior.
- Example `.lst` file structure:
  ```txt
  model1.obj
  model2.obj
  model3.obj
  ```

### **3. Run the Simulation**
- Run the Unity project using the Unity Editor or build an executable for standalone use.
- Pass command-line arguments to the executable to customize the behavior.

**Example Command** (Standalone Executable):
```bash
MyLiDARProject.exe --out_dir="C:/scans" --in_path="C:/models/list.lst" --random_rotation=false --rescans=5
```

## **Output**
The simulation generates the following output in the specified `out_dir`:
1. **Point Cloud Files**:  
   Point cloud Saved in OFF formats. two set of point cloud is generated for each model. A ground truth one and a noisy one
2. **Organized Folders**:  
   Each scan session is composed of multiple frames. You can find all the OFF file in the frames subfolder
